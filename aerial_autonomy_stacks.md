# Aerial Autonomy Stacks

Based on [this discussion in Discourse]( https://discourse.ros.org/t/more-aerial-autonomy-stacks/30992/) and [our startup meeting](https://discourse.ros.org/t/start-up-meeting-aerial-robotics-wg/30869), we can define an aerial autonomy stack as follows:

> An aerial autonomy robotics stack is a collection of building blocks that enable the development of autonomous aerial vehicles, by providing a modular and scalable architecture for sensing, perception, planning, and control tasks. It allows unmanned aerial vehicles to perform complex missions without human intervention, while accommodating different hardware configurations and simulation environments.
